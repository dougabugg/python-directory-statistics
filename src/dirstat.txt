Some things I would like to change: mostly aesthetics, just perfecting the layout, small things. For the most part, this part of the program is done. The only other thing I have left to do is wrap the code in a class and allow the user to select a snapshot.

One major thing concerning the FolderTree widget is sorting. By default, sorting sorts by node type (folder or file), then by column, and then by name. This gets a little complicated with ascending and descending by default for numerical columns, but I feel like it ought to be different. For example, sorting by size should not sort by node type first (maybe?), but the current method is how windows explorer sorts, so I guess it is ok for now...

Also, the NodeInfoFrame widget is incomplete. There is no button to browse the folder in windows explorer. In addition, stat times are not implemented (this goes for FolderTree widget too).
