# Python Directory Statistics
 
This program started out as a rough clone of [WinDirStat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinDirStat), that could save the directory statistics to a compressed JSON "snapshot" file. I had planned to add the ability to compare two snapshots, and view the changes between them, but never got that far. Most of the code here was initially written in May of 2014. As of 2021, that was over 7 years ago! Back then, I was probably using Python version 3.4, since wikipedia says 3.5 wasn't released until September 2014.

I thought it would be fun to look at the old code I wrote, so I decided to upload it to GitHub. To run the main GUI program, start the `dirstat.py` file, with a command like `python dirstat.py` with `src` as your working directory.
